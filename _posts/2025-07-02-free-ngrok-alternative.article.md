# The Best Free ngrok Alternative: Meet Tunnelmole (Open Source & Easy to Use)

If you’re a developer who needs to expose your local server to the internet—whether for testing webhooks, sharing a dev site, or remote collaboration—you’ve probably heard of ngrok. But ngrok’s free plan comes with limitations: random subdomains, limited tunnels, and it’s closed source. If you’re searching for a **free ngrok alternative** that’s open source, easy to use, and self-hostable, you’re in the right place.

**Tunnelmole** is a standout solution for developers who want more control, transparency, and flexibility. In this guide, you’ll learn:

- Why developers look for a free ngrok alternative
- What makes Tunnelmole unique
- How to install and use Tunnelmole in seconds
- Real-world use cases and integration tips
- Feature comparison: Tunnelmole vs. ngrok (free)
- How to self-host Tunnelmole for maximum control

## Why Developers Search for a Free ngrok Alternative

ngrok is a popular tunneling tool, but its free plan has several restrictions that can slow down your workflow:

- **Random subdomains only** (no custom domains)
- **Limited concurrent tunnels**
- **Closed source** (no code transparency)
- **Usage limits** (sessions, bandwidth, etc.)
- **No self-hosting** (vendor lock-in)

For many developers, these limitations are dealbreakers—especially if you need a public URL for webhooks, want to share your work with clients, or require open source transparency for security and compliance.

## How Tunnelmole Works

Tunnelmole creates a secure tunnel from your local machine to a public URL. Here’s a high-level overview:

1. **You run Tunnelmole** on your local machine, specifying the port your app is running on.
2. **Tunnelmole connects** to the tunnelmole service (cloud service or self-hosted).
3. **A public URL** is generated (e.g., `https://abc12.tunnelmole.net`).
4. **Incoming requests** to the public URL are securely forwarded to your local server through the client.

## Tunnelmole FAQ

### Is Tunnelmole really free and open source?

Yes! Both the client and server are open source. Use the hosted service for free public URLs, or self-host for full control.

### Does Tunnelmole hide my IP?

No. For abuse prevention, the hosted service adds your IP to the `X-Forwarded-For` header and the URL. You can self-host and modify this if needed.

### Can I use custom domains?

Yes, with a paid subscription on the hosted service, or by self-hosting.
