## Why Look for an ngrok Alternative on Linux?

ngrok is a well-known tunneling tool, but it comes with some limitations:

- **Free plan restrictions:** Limited concurrent tunnels, session timeouts, and random subdomains.
- **Closed source:** You can’t audit or self-host the service.
- **Pricing:** Advanced features require a paid subscription.
- **Installer friction:** Some users prefer a simple, scriptable install or want to avoid proprietary binaries.

If you want a tool that’s open source, free to use, and works seamlessly on Linux, it’s time to check out Tunnelmole.

## How to Install Tunnelmole on Linux

Tunnelmole is designed for a frictionless install on Linux. You have two main options:

### 1. Install via Shell Script (Recommended for Linux)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -O https://install.tunnelmole.com/xD345/install && sudo bash install
```

The script auto-detects your OS and installs the right binary for your Linux distribution.

### 2. Install via npm (Requires Node.js 16.10+)

If you already use Node.js, you can install Tunnelmole globally:

```bash
sudo npm install -g tunnelmole
```

> **Tip:** Get Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or your distro’s package manager.

## How to Use Tunnelmole on Linux

Let’s say you have a local web app running on port 8080. To get a public URL:

```bash
tmole 8080
```

You’ll see output like:

```
https://cqcu2t-ip-49-185-26-79.tunnelmole.net ⟶ http://localhost:8080
http://cqcu2t-ip-49-185-26-79.tunnelmole.net ⟶ http://localhost:8080
```

Now, anyone can access your local app via the provided HTTPS URL.

**Common use cases:**

- Test webhooks from Stripe, GitHub, or IFTTT on your Linux machine
- Share your local React, Node.js, or static site with teammates
- Preview mobile versions of your site on real devices
- Demo your work to clients without deploying
