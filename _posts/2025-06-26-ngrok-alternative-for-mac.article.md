## Why Look for an ngrok Alternative on Mac?

ngrok is a well-known tunneling tool, but it comes with some limitations:

- **Free plan restrictions:** Limited concurrent tunnels, session timeouts, and random subdomains.
- **Closed source:** You can’t audit or self-host the service.
- **Pricing:** Advanced features require a paid subscription.
- **Installation friction:** Some users report issues with ngrok’s installer or prefer a Homebrew-free workflow.

If you want a tool that’s open source, free to use, and works seamlessly on macOS, it’s time to check out Tunnelmole.

## How to Use Tunnelmole on macOS

Let’s say you have a local web app running on port 8080. To get a public URL:

```bash
tmole 8080
```

You’ll see output like:

```
https://cqcu2t-ip-49-185-26-79.tunnelmole.net ⟶ http://localhost:8080
http://cqcu2t-ip-49-185-26-79.tunnelmole.net ⟶ http://localhost:8080
```

Now, anyone can access your local app via the provided HTTPS URL.

**Common use cases:**

- Test webhooks from Stripe, GitHub, or IFTTT on your Mac
- Share your local React, Node.js, or static site with teammates
- Preview mobile versions of your site on real devices
