## Why Look for an ngrok Alternative on Windows?

ngrok is a well-known tunneling tool, but it comes with some limitations:

- **Free plan restrictions:** Limited concurrent tunnels, session timeouts, and random subdomains.
- **Closed source:** You can’t audit or self-host the service.
- **Pricing:** Advanced features require a paid subscription.
- **Installer friction:** Some users report issues with ngrok’s installer or prefer a portable, no-login workflow.

If you want a tool that’s open source, free to use, and works seamlessly on Windows, it’s time to check out Tunnelmole.
