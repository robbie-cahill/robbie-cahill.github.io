Welcome to your new Jekyll site! This is your first blog post, demonstrating how easy it is to create content with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs. It's the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can host your Jekyll-powered website for free on GitHub.

## Key Benefits

- **Simple**: No databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install
- **Static**: Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment
- **Blog-aware**: Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens

## Writing Posts

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

### Code Highlighting

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
const greeting = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greeting('World');
```

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Lists (like this one!)
