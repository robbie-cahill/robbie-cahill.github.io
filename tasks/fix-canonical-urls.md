Correct: https://softwareengineeringstandard.com/2025/07/04/linux-mint/ (Last part matches `slug`)


`_posts/2025-07-04-linux-virtual-machine.article.md`
Incorrect: https://softwareengineeringstandard.com/2025/07/04/how-to-get-a-public-url-for-your-linux-virtual-machine-with-tunnelmole/
Correct: https://softwareengineeringstandard.com/2025/07/04/linux-virtual-machine/

Fix up all the articles here, except the ones with `2025-07-12` in the article filename, those ones have the correct canonical URL already.
